# Awesome Reference Architecture<br/>

[![awesome-badge](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of reference architectures.

Inspired by the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list.

[Reference architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_architecture) aims to describe the high level
structures of software as well as the discipline of creating them. As this topic is pretty broad, it might
contain some resources that are also present in more niche lists.
